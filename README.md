# Quaked

Quake in the browser, built on Three.js. Quaked is developed by [@codemeasandwich](https://github.com/codemeasandwich) and is based on [three-quake](https://github.com/mrdoob/three-quake) by [@mrdoob](https://github.com/mrdoob).

### Play

https://mrdoob.github.io/three-quake/ (upstream three-quake build)

### Features

#### Live portals

Every teleporter surface (`*teleport`) that leads somewhere is a live camera onto its receiver. The world is rendered a second time from the destination, so the teleporter looks cut out of the wall with a slight shimmer, and what you see through it is the space you step into.

- Destinations come from the map's own entities (`trigger_teleport` → `info_teleport_destination`), so it works on any map.
- Up to 3 nearest visible portals are rendered per frame, at 75% resolution.
- `r_portals 0` in the console turns it off and restores the classic swirl.
- Teleporting is quieter: the sound stays, the white particle burst is gone, and the launch out of the teleporter is halved (300 to 150 units/s).
- Limits: entities the server doesn't send near you (monsters, other players at the receiver) don't appear in the window; a portal seen through another portal shows the plain swirl; portals are off in WebXR.
